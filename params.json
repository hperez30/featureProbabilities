  "body": "### Context.\r\nVariability models play a key role in product line engineering as they are used to represent the common and\r\nvariable features that products may include, and what constraints among the features must be satisfied to guarantee\r\nthe validity of the products. Valuable analysis operations on variability models can be performed by black box reusing\r\nlogic engines, such as SAT-solvers and binary decision diagram libraries. Unfortunately, such kind of reuse implies\r\nlong computation times for operations that need calling the engines many times. To overcome this problem, we work on\r\nnew algorithms that directly deal with the data structure of a binary decision diagram encoding a variability model. In particular, the algorithm published in this site is specifically designed to compute feature commonalities.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nThis repository provides an algorithm to compute feature commonalities, which is written in the C++ programming language as an extension of the [Buddy BDD library](http://buddy.sourceforge.net/manual/main.html).\r\n\r\n### How to Install BuDDy.\r\nFollow the instructions in this section to install the BuDDy BDD package on your system, if it is not already installed.\r\n* Download <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/\">buddy-2.4.tar.gz</a> (766,5 kB).\r\n* Unzip \"gunzip buddy-2.4.tar.gz\".\r\n* Untar \"tar xvf buddy-2.4.tar\". \r\n* \"./configure\"\r\n* \"make\"\r\n* \"make install\" \r\n\r\n### BuDDy Documentation\r\nThe buddy-2.4/doc directory contains documentation for the BuDDy package in postscript. An introduction to binary decision diagrams is described in the bddnotes.ps file. In addition, you can find a full description of the buddy package in buddy.ps.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nFollow the instructions in this section to install our algorithm implementation.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis work has been developed by [Hector Perez-Morago](href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hector_Perez-Morago\").\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you need further information, do not hesitate to contact Hector Perez-Morago (hectormorago@gmail.com). \r\n",
