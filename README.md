# featureProbabilities

This directory contains a set of files that allow you to get the core and features 
of a variability model codified into a BDD using the BuDDy BDD package.

The BuDDy package is a package for the manipulation of binary decision 
diagrams (BDDs), and it can be found on the server http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/.

Our algorithm is written in C++ and it uses buddy for computing core and dead features
form variability model.

INSTALLATION

To use our algorithm you will need to install BuDDy BDD package in your system. Follow 
the instructions in this section to install BuDDy BDD package on your system.
